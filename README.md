# flappy Bird Ai
Overview
This project implements an AI for the popular game Flappy Bird using a genetic algorithm. The AI learns to play the game by evolving through generations, with each generation getting better at navigating the pipes. This repository provides an exciting demonstration of how evolutionary algorithms can be applied to game environments for creating intelligent agents.

Features
Genetic Algorithm Implementation: The core of this project is a genetic algorithm that evolves a population of neural networks to play Flappy Bird. The algorithm uses crossover and mutation to produce new generations, allowing the AI to improve over time.
Neural Network Architecture: Each bird (AI agent) is controlled by a simple neural network that takes inputs from the game environment and outputs actions (flap or not). This design demonstrates how even simple neural networks can learn complex behaviors through evolution.
Visualization: The project includes a visualization of the birds learning to play the game. You can watch as the AI improves with each generation, avoiding obstacles more effectively.
Customizability: The code is modular and well-documented, making it easy for users to tweak parameters like population size, mutation rate, and the neural network's architecture to experiment with different setups and observe their effects on learning.
Getting Started
To run the project, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions in the README. The project requires Python and a few additional libraries, such as NumPy and Pygame. Once set up, simply run the main script to start training the AI.

Future Improvements
Enhanced Neural Network Architecture: Experimenting with deeper or more complex neural network structures could potentially yield better results.
Advanced Selection Strategies: Implementing more sophisticated selection mechanisms, such as tournament selection or fitness proportionate selection, could improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm.
Cross-Platform Support: Expanding support to other operating systems and environments for broader accessibility.
Conclusion
This Flappy Bird AI project is a fantastic example of applying genetic algorithms to real-world problems, showcasing the power of evolutionary computation in game AI development. Itâ€™s a great starting point for anyone interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, or game development.
